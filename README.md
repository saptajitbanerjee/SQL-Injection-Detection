# SQL-Injection-Detection
 My team built a Machine Learning model to detect SQL Injections. The dataset was prepared by capturing normal and malicious HTTP requests, extracting essential features for training the model effectively. It enhances web application security by accurately identifying and flagging SQL Injection attacks.
